"""Contrib feature implementations.

This package contains the feature implementations that are discovered
and loaded by the workbench infrastructure.

Each feature should have its own subdirectory with:
- manifest.py: Feature metadata and run function
- service.py: Feature implementation (optional, for legacy support)
